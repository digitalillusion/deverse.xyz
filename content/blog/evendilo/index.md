A tool to synchronize an online shop inventory from an excel file toward Woocommerce and ebay.

Allows for creation of product and update of its characteristics like category, price, quantity, pictures and description directly in the excel file, then uploaded through the minimal user interface.

For each line of the excel file, a report is generated in real time, stating if the line was imported correctly or if there was any error.

The excel file contains a specific set of columns and a timestamp for each added or modified row, so that data is retrieved from the right place and only new and updated rows are processed, greatly reducing waiting time.
