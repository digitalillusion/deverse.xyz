My portfolio website, the one you are browsing.

Its aim is to present the various project I've worked on as freelancer along with the ones I am still working on, in a sleek and appealing gallery.

Conceived as a simple presentational website powered by Gatsby JS, it features categorized blog-like content and internationalization.

Its responsive design makes it available for consultation from both mobile and desktop browsers.
