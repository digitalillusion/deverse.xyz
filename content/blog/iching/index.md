A free, complete and portable I Ching Oracle for Android.

Includes full description of all hexagrams and changing lines, governing lines, constituent lines, history feature, saves itself on SD card or on internal storage and uses network to download definitions in order to be extra light weight.

Allows to use a custom dictionary inherited from the default one to personalize the hexagrams interpretation. When put in offline mode, after a complete download, all dictionaries become accessible without the need of an internet connection.

Uses the three coins method to cast hexagrams, by randomly generating coin toss or by manual input. Allows to choose whether to evaluate changing lines by manual interpretation or by using either Master Yin or Nanjing algorithm.

Readings can be saved in different histories and there is the possibility to password protect the access to those files. Otherwise, each section of the reading can be shared toward other applications that read HTML.
